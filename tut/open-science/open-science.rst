Science and Software development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Free software and science
* Software development strategies
* Project management and participation
* How to design software

These topics aren't for primary scientific purposes, but help you to
become better rounded.

.. epigraph::

   The things we cover today aren't direct, small tools that you can
   apply to your projects, like most other talks.  Instead, these are
   important for general education purposes.  On goal of this course
   is designed to help you transfer to a professional company doing
   software development, and today does that.

   - Free software: One should know how and why code should be
     released under a Free license, so that others can use it and
     build on your work.  Science isn't just algorithms in papers, but
     code can greatly increase the pace, too.  Of course, the code
     needs to be good for this to be useful.  That's what all the rest
     of the course is about.

   - Software development strategies: This isn't going to be
     immediately useful, since trying to impose structure on your work
     is hard.  Instead, you will learn about some development
     strategies so that in the future, you can join and work on larger
     teams.  Perhaps it will even help you to work with your
     colleagues better.  This is kind of academic/theoretical.

   - Project management and participation: This is the practical side
     of the previous topic.  It has concrete ideas that can even help
     your group to work together.

   - How to design software: This is a bit abstract.  It packages a
     lot of the tools we have learned so far, and provides some
     closing lessons on code modularity, reuse, and so on.


Free Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Movement started in 1980s
* Other names: "Open Source", "FLOSS" (free libre open source software)
* Started as reaction to closing nature of software in 1970s
* What science should be


Free software principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Freedom to run program for any purpose
* Freedom to understand how the program works ("open source")
* Freedom to redistribute
* Freedom to modify and improve, and share your improvements.

**Not** the same as:
* "Freely distributed"
* "Open source"
* Source code on someone's web page


Contrasts to other ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Commercial software: FS can be a business strategy
* "Freely distributed": Can't be re-shared
* "Open source": sometimes a marketing term, can't be shared/modified
* "Non-commercial": FS allows commercial use.

Why you need a license
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Everything is copyright by default (thanks, big corporations)
  - No permission to re-share or modify and reshare.
* You probably want to disclaim warranty.

Types of licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* No license
  - Can not be re-shared.  Status questionable.
* BSD/MIT: most liberal
  - Do whatever you want, no warranty, attribute copyright
* Gnu General Public License (GPL): "copyleft" (virulent)
  - Do whatever you want, but modifications must also be GPL.
* (Gnu) Affero General Public License (AGPL): "copyleft" for webapps
  - Like GPL, but closes the webapp loophole.

How to apply a license
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Minimum: put the file in your source code.
* FIXME

License compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
