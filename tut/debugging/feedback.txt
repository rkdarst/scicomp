- Raj: You should put the simpler examples first, something closer to
  what people would actually use.  As it is, the earlier methods you
  discuss are very abstract so a new person would be confused.


- Faria: I have too much stuff, there are too many different ways of
  doing things.  Could I remove most of them and have just the main
  methods, and then more examples/interaction?

- For next time:
  - Make one way to do each thing.  Have just three tasks:
    - %debug
    - pdb from command line
    - pdb.set_trace()
  - Have a lot of the rest be examples.

  - Have a table at the end summarizing the different options.  

  - issues with multithreaded programs
