Information for day1: version control system introduction
=========================================================

This page is the companion

What version control system to use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the class, I teach the basics of the ``git`` version control
system.  It is one of many different systems.  Perhaps it is not the
most simple to use, but it is the most common with a lot of support.
You should discuss with your group and see what people use, and adopt
that.

The most common systems are:

* `git <http://www.git-scm.com/>`_
* `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_ (hg)
* `Subversion <https://subversion.apache.org/>`_ (not a distributed
  version control system, so I wouldn't recommend this for personal
  projects)


Installation of git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whatever system you choose, you will need to install it yourself.  It
is already installed on all BECS-managed Linux and windows computers.

The git web page has information on downloading and installation.

The "official" distributions can be downloaded from
http://www.git-scm.com/downloads



To do
~~~~~

* Explore the repository for this course on Github:
  https://github.com/rkdarst/scicomp/

  - Find the changelog (history)
  - Find how to view diffs of commits
  - Find how to view the "annotations" (who last edited each line) of files
  - When was the project started?


"Homework"
~~~~~~~~~~

* Create a git repository for one of your own projects
* Use it for one week, making commits as necessary
* Send me the commit log once you have been using the project for a
  week

  - You can get this log by ``git log > git-log.txt``
