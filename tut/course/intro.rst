Introduction: Practical programming tools for researchers
=========================================================

Purpose of this course
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Some scientists program *all the time*
* Yet, most scientists have limited training in software development tools
* This course should

  - Make you better at research
  - Allow you a better transition into industry

What this course will do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Provide an introduction to software development tools...
* ... targeted towards practicing scientists
* Provide an appreciation of software development
* Provide information for future study

How this class works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Each lecture is self-contained on some topic
* Each lecture is (mostly) immediately applicable to your work
* Not programming-language specific
* Lectures provide background and ideas

  - You will have to do independent work for your problem, language,
    and workflow.

* Mostly discussion-based, not just lectures

Why might this course be important?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Your code works properly, but you spend days fixing or debugging
  things
* It is easier to work alone than with other people (but you need to
  collaborate to do science)
* You realize a bug made you lose the last six months of your
  work
