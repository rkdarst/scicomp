Assignments for the course
==========================

This course is not primarily focused on assignments.  Instead, the
goal is to use the lessons learned in your actual work.  However,
in order for there to be credits there should be *something* shown.
The "assignments" below should be adapted to your actual work in any
way possible, and some sort of minimal evidence should be produced
and sent in.

Please also fill in the `course feedback form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FDKiNKEOUdgt_sqnFxisqFShI5GiioipN-fo_lq9wYc/viewform>`_.

The assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Create a git (or any other version control system) repository.  Send
  in some evidence of it, for example the output from the ``git log``
  command showing a few commits.  (days 1, 2)
* Set up a ``.git/config`` file with some useful commands.  Use either
  my examples, or other examples you find on the internet.  Send the
  file.  This could also be done for any other version control
  system's config file.  (day 7)
* Use a debugger.  To show evidence of this, you could give a
  screenshot of it or copy and paste the console output.  If you don't
  have a case to use a debugger right now, make an artificial error
  and use the debugger to print some variables around there.  (day 3)
* Profile some code.  Send some output from this, for example the
  ``gprof2dot`` output or output from the console-based profile
  viewer. (day 4)
* Create one (or several) unit tests.  There are no particular
  requirements here, you should just make something useful to you.  If
  unit tests aren't relevant to your work, then have some sort of
  script that automatically runs something to test that it still
  works.  If you don't have any kind of common code that can be
  tested, then perhaps take the other option below. (day 5, 6)
* Create a ``.ssh/config`` file and put some useful stuff in it.  For
  example, define an alias to automatically set ``HostName`` and
  ``User`` for sshing with less typing.  You could send the relevant parts of
  the file.  Or, make some ssh keys, and send output from the ``ls
  .ssh`` of the directory  (day 9)


Back-up option: If any of these would require too much work with no
benefit to you, instead write a few sentences about the purpose of the
technique, and how you would use it in your work.

In general, please be creative in adapting the assignments to fit your
actual research work, including picking the best technique from that
day and even adapting the assignment into something useful for you.

Submit results by email to: rkd@zgib.net (either all at once or as
they are completed).
