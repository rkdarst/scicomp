Information for day 2: git collaboration and gitlab
===================================================

Before class
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* First, please make a Gitlab account if you haven't already done
  so. The instructions are on our department's wiki here:

  https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/becsintra/Gitlab

  This is run by our IT people. 

  - Gitlab has been upgraded since those instructions were written, so
    the account creation process may be a bit simpler now.

  - If you can log in, you have done enough.

* Second, please bring a computer to class. We will have examples to
  do together.
