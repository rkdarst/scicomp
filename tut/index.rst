This is the index of tutorials on scientific computing basics.  These
are not specific to *high-performance* computing (yet), but the basics
of software development that everyone who programs should know.  This
project is still new, so you still see the versions for each specific
audience (and partially incomplete or buggy, depending on the state
when it was presented).

This page has existed only a few weeks, so is under active
development.  Also, a new tutorial appears every 2-3 weeks.
