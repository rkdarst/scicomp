Scientific Software Development tutorials
=========================================

This is the index of tutorials on software development for scientific
computing basics.  These are not specific to *high-performance*
computing (yet), but introduce the standard tools that professional
devolpers already have which solve the *practical* problems in writing
code: tracking revisions, debugging, making it correct, making it
fast, and so on.  Basically, the raw material that scientists need in
order to do their work the best.

The format is designed to be short packets of tools or ideas which can
be immediately used, not detailed theory.  If talks come in groups of
two, the first is a discussion about why and how we might want to use
some tool, and the second is a practical (and hands-on) introduction
to the topic.


This project is still new, so you still see the versions for each
specific audience (and partially incomplete or buggy, depending on the
state when it was presented).  This page has existed only a few weeks,
so is under active development.  Also, a new tutorial hopefully
appears every 2-3 weeks, or whenever I can present them.

.. tut-index::

   git-10-minute/git-10-minute          10 Minute Git
   git-collaboration/gitlab-and-collaboration  Gitlab and collaboration
   testing/testing                      Introduction to software testing
   testing-2/testing-2                  Software testing with Python
   debugging/debugging                  Debugging

The following tutorials are "under development": they have some
content, but have not been presented yet and thus are not fully
structurally sound:

.. tut-index::

   tut/practical/practical-correct-programs  Practical suggestions for writing good programs.  Putting all the other tutorials together.
   tut/profiling/profiling              Profiling and optimizing data structures
